# Browsy – Modular Android Browser App (Beta)

Welcome to **Browsy**, a lightweight, privacy-first browser built from scratch in just two weeks. This project is a personal challenge to explore new territory and prove that with the right tools and mindset, you can build something powerful even from zero.

## 🚀 About the App

**Browsy** is currently in early development and available for public testing. It features:

- 🌓 Dark & Light Mode Toggle  
- 🗂️ Tab Management  
- 🔖 Bookmarking & Sharing  
- 🔒 Privacy-Focused Architecture  
- ⚙️ Modular Design for Speed & Flexibility

This app is still in **beta**, so expect some rough edges. Your feedback is incredibly valuable as I continue to refine and expand its capabilities.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

Instead of building something familiar like a LinkedIn extension, I wanted to challenge myself with a project I had never attempted before. *Browsy* is the result — a fully functional browser app built using Kotlin, Android Studio, and AI-assisted development workflows.

This project showcases:
- Rapid prototyping using modern tools
- Clean UI/UX design principles
- Modular architecture for scalability
- A commitment to privacy and user control

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- WebView  
- AI-driven development (Copilot, prompt engineering)

## 📣 Feedback

If you try the app and have thoughts, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.
